All officially confirmed cases of infection in Germany. Listed by case number, date, federal state, latitude, longitude, source.

<b>Field description</b>

- No: The sequential numbering of the case numbers
- Date: MM/DD/YYYY (German time, UTC+1)
- Federated state: Where the case was confirmed
- District: In which district the case occurred in the respective federal state
- Latitude: The latitude of the district
- Longitude: The longitude of the district

<b>Note - General</b>

For a simple overview of the course in Germany, the given values (case number, date, federal state, county and coordinates of the county are sufficient. In many cases, additional information is available. This includes the exact city of the infected person, gender, age and an indication of how the case is related to another. However, this information is not always published by the authorities. Therefore I do not put this online either.

<b>Note - N/A display</b>

For the 6 cases from Bavaria (2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16) I could not find a location so far. The Bavarian authorities had not given any more precise information so far. These 6 cases are the only cases so far without further information. All others have the exact data.

<b>Note - Sources</b>

As a rule, I exclusively use the health ministry of the respective federal state as a source. However, it happens again and again that the federal authorities need several hours, several days for it, until they publish an information. Therefore it happens from time to time that a county is indicated as source. In rare cases a hospital or a university is also indicated as a source, since these are to be likewise classified as respectable sources.

<b>Note - Time zone</b>

The indicated date in each case refers to the German time. This is UTC+1. 

<b>Note - Frequency of updates</b>

The data is updated several times a day. These vary due to the dynamic conditions.

<b>Disclaimer</b>

I compile and maintain the list of German infection cases with the best of conscience. I use all open channels available to me for this purpose. The listing and compilation is truthful. A manipulation on my part does not take place. I only use official authorities (federal state, county, city) as sources (as mentioned above). I trust in the correctness of the authorities that publish the information. I cannot guarantee a 100 percent completeness and correctness of the data. I expressly reject any claims against me due to incorrect data.
